# How to Design PCBs with Mentor Graphics PADS 2009
 
If you are looking for a powerful and easy-to-use software for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs), you might want to check out Mentor Graphics PADS 2009. PADS stands for Personal Automated Design System, and it is a suite of tools that allows you to create, edit, simulate, and verify PCB designs. In this article, we will show you how to use PADS 2009 to design a simple PCB from scratch.

## Step 1: Create a New Project
 
To start a new project in PADS 2009, you need to launch the PADS Logic tool, which is the schematic capture and design entry tool. You can do this by clicking on the Start menu, selecting All Programs, Mentor Graphics SDD, PADS 2009, and then PADS Logic. Alternatively, you can double-click on the PADS Logic icon on your desktop.
 
Once PADS Logic opens, you will see a blank workspace with a toolbar on the top and a menu bar on the left. To create a new project, click on File > New > Project. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the name of your project and choose a location to save it. You can also select a template for your project from the list of available templates. For this example, we will use the default template.
 
Click OK to create your new project. You will see a new window with a blank schematic sheet where you can start drawing your circuit.
 
## Step 2: Add Components and Wires
 
To add components to your schematic, you can use the Component Browser tool, which is located on the left menu bar. Click on the Component Browser icon to open it. You will see a list of libraries that contain various components that you can use in your design. You can browse through the libraries by clicking on the plus signs next to them. You can also search for a specific component by typing its name or part number in the search box.
 
To place a component on your schematic sheet, simply drag and drop it from the Component Browser to the desired location. You can also double-click on a component to place it at the center of your sheet. You can move or rotate a component by selecting it and using the arrow keys or the right mouse button.
 
To connect components with wires, you can use the Wire tool, which is located on the top toolbar. Click on the Wire icon to activate it. Then click on a pin of a component and drag your mouse to another pin of another component. Release your mouse button to complete the wire. You can also click multiple times to create bends in your wire.
 
You can change the color, width, or style of your wires by using the Properties tool, which is located on the top toolbar. Click on the Properties icon to open it. Then select one or more wires and change their properties as desired.
 
## Step 3: Add Text and Symbols
 
To add text or symbols to your schematic, you can use the Text tool or the Symbol tool, which are located on the top toolbar. Click on the Text icon or the Symbol icon to activate them. Then click on an empty space on your sheet and type your text or select your symbol from the list. You can also drag and drop text or symbols from other sources, such as documents or websites.
 
You can change the font, size, color, or alignment of your text by using the Properties tool. You can also change the shape, size, color, or orientation of your symbols by using the Properties tool.
 
## Step 4: Check and Save Your Design
 
To check your design for errors or warnings, you can use the Design Rule Check (DRC) tool, which is located on the top toolbar. Click on the DRC icon to run it. A dialog box will appear where you can select which rules you want to check and how you want to display the results. Click OK to start the check.
 
If there are any errors or warnings in your design, they will be highlighted in red or yellow on your schematic sheet. You can also see a list of them in the DRC window at the bottom of your screen. You can double-click on an error or warning
